As of 2024 I am officially a Software Engineer by occupation, but I realized haven't contributed anything of value to the web. So this is my tribute, my small addition to this vast pit of gloom and glory. I think I've missed the golden years of the blog, when some dude under covers as 'gnarly barkly' could word vomit about the state of basketball and the Bush presidency and get a cool 100 views, but I'm not sweating it. I think I'll write about more modest things like criterion releases and what chase card will get you more bang for your buck. I am basically the opposite of a man of the people.</br>
